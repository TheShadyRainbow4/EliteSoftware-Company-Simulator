<!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->



<div align="center">

## **🚀 Welcome to EliteSoftware! 🚀**

</div>

Ever wondered what it's like to work in a chaotic, unpredictable, and entirely simulated corporate environment? Now you can! The **EliteSoftware Company Simulator** is a React-based web application that drops you into the role of an employee at the fictional (and slightly unhinged) "EliteSoftware" company.

This project is a playground, a sandbox, and a testament to what happens when you let an AI co-pilot (Google's Gemini) have a little too much fun. It's **vibe-coded**, meaning it was built with a focus on creativity, rapid development, and seeing just how far we can push AI-driven interactions.

**Disclaimer:** This is purely a for-fun, portfolio project. It is not intended for production use, and probably breaks about a dozen software engineering best practices. And that's the way we like it!



<!-- CORE FEATURES SECTION -->



## **✨ Core Features**

The simulation is a rich, interactive experience packed with features designed to create a dynamic and emergent narrative:

* **🤖 AI-Powered Coworkers:** The office is filled with AI colleagues who have unique personalities, roles, and relationships. They'll email you, chat with you, and even post on the company's social media, all on their own!

* **📧 Full Email Client:** Send and receive emails. Watch as your AI coworkers start email chains, reply-all to everything, and generate tasks for you.

* **💬 Instant Messenger:** A real-time chat application for group conversations and direct messages.

* **📅 Project Management:** Create and manage projects, assign team members, and watch as your AI team *actually* makes progress (or gets distracted).

* **🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Company Directory & Org Chart:** Get to know your simulated colleagues and understand the corporate hierarchy.

* **🌐 Internal Social Media:** A company-wide social feed where AI-generated content creates a lively (and often hilarious) internal culture.

* **👑 Full Admin Control:** An admin panel lets you become the puppet master. Create users, edit AI coworker personalities, generate random events, and steer the simulation however you see fit.

* **🕰️ Simulation Engine:** The simulation has its own internal clock. Pause, play, and advance time to see the consequences of your actions (and the AI's shenanigans) unfold.



<!-- TECH STACK SECTION -->



## **💻 Tech Stack**

* **Frontend Framework:** React 19 + TypeScript
* **Build Tool:** Vite
* **Desktop Runtime:** Electron

<!-- INSTALLATION SECTION -->



## **🛠️ Getting Started: Your First Day on the Job**

Ready to clock in? Here’s how to get the simulation running on your local machine.

### **Prerequisites**

* **Node.js:** Make sure you have a recent version of Node.js installed.

* **Gemini API Key:** The AI magic is powered by Google's Gemini models. You'll need an API key to bring your coworkers to life. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### **Installation & Setup**

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/elitesoftware-company/EliteSoftware-Company-Simulator.git](https://github.com/elitesoftware-company/EliteSoftware-Company-Simulator.git)
   cd EliteSoftware-Company-Simulator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   This project uses `npm`. Run the following command to install all the necessary packages.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up your environment:**
   Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of the project directory. This is where you'll put your secret API key.

   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_super_secret_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the development server:**
   You're all set! Run the command below to start the application.

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will launch, and you can access it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is busy).



<!-- PROJECT STRUCTURE SECTION -->



## **📂 Project Structure**

Here's a quick overview of how the codebase is organized:

*   **`components/`**: Contains all the React components that make up the UI (e.g., `InboxView`, `InstantMessengerView`, `BootSequence`).
*   **`hooks/`**: Custom React hooks, primarily `useLocalStorage` for persisting state.
*   **`services/`**: Handles external service integrations, specifically the `geminiService` for AI interactions.
*   **`components/icons/`**: A collection of custom SVG icon components used throughout the application.
*   **`main.cjs`**: The entry point for the Electron main process.
*   **`preload.cjs`**: The Electron preload script that securely bridges the main process and the renderer.



<!-- VIBE CODING NOTE SECTION -->



## **📜 A Note on "Vibe Coding"**

This project was built in close collaboration with Google's Gemini. Many features, design choices, and lines of code were generated or heavily influenced by AI. The goal was less about perfect, clean code and more about exploring the creative potential of human-AI partnership. It's an experiment in letting the "vibe" of an idea guide the development process.

Expect the unexpected. Embrace the chaos. And have fun!

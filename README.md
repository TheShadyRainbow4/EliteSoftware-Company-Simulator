<!-- INTRODUCTION SECTION -->



## **🚀 Welcome to EliteSoftware!**

Ever wondered what it's like to work in a chaotic, unpredictable, and entirely simulated corporate environment? Now you can! The **EliteSoftware Company Simulator** is a React-based web application that drops you into the role of an employee at the fictional (and slightly unhinged) "EliteSoftware" company.

This project is a playground, a sandbox, and a testament to what happens when you let an AI co-pilot (Google's Gemini) have a little too much fun. It's **vibe-coded**, meaning it was built with a focus on creativity, rapid development, and seeing just how far we can push AI-driven interactions.

**Disclaimer:** This is purely a for-fun, portfolio project. It is not intended for production use, and probably breaks about a dozen software engineering best practices. And that's the way we like it!

---

## **📖 The Lore**

Welcome to **EliteSoftware**, the premier (fictional) provider of vaguely defined software solutions. We are a company that values "Synergy," "Paradigm Shifts," and "Circling Back" above all else.

Our office is populated by a cast of colorful AI characters, from the overly enthusiastic intern who uses too many emojis, to the cynical senior dev who replies to everything with "It works on my machine." As a new hire, you'll navigate office politics, manage nonsensical projects, and try to survive the daily grind of a simulated tech giant.

Will you rise to the top and become the CEO? Or will you get bogged down in endless reply-all email chains about the break room microwave? The choice is yours (and the AI's).

## **✨ Core Features**

The simulation is a rich, interactive experience packed with features designed to create a dynamic and emergent narrative.

### **🤖 AI Personality Engine**
The heart of EliteSoftware is its **AI Personality Engine**.
*   **Unique Personas:** Every coworker has a distinct personality, role, communication style, and set of relationships.
*   **Autonomous Behavior:** They don't just wait for you. They email each other, post on social media, and complete tasks even when you're not looking.
*   **Context Awareness:** They remember past interactions, your role in the company, and the current state of projects.

### **📧 EliteMail (Inbox)**
A fully functional, simulated email client.
*   **Dynamic Threads:** Watch as email chains spiral out of control with "Reply All" disasters.
*   **Task Generation:** Emails often contain hidden tasks or requests that update your project board.
*   **Smart Replies:** Draft responses or let the AI suggest a "professional" (or passive-aggressive) reply for you.

### **💬 EliteChat (Instant Messenger)**
Real-time collaboration (and procrastination).
*   **Group Channels:** distinct channels for #general, #random, #dev-team, and more.
*   **Direct Messages:** Have private conversations with specific coworkers.
*   **Live Typing:** See when coworkers are typing, adding to the immersion.

### **📅 Calendar & Schedule**
Manage your time effectively (or pretend to).
*   **Meeting Invites:** Receive and accept meeting invites that populate your calendar.
*   **Deadlines:** Visual indicators for upcoming project deadlines.
*   **Company Events:** Don't miss the mandatory "Fun Friday" virtual happy hour!

### **🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Directory & Org Chart**
Know who you're dealing with.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** See the reporting lines and understand who holds the power.
*   **Employee Profiles:** Click on any employee to see their bio, skills, and current mood.

### **🌐 The "Hub" (Internal Social Media)**
The pulse of the company culture.
*   **News Feed:** A scrolling feed of company announcements, employee achievements, and lunch photos.
*   **Interactions:** Like, comment, and share posts. Watch as drama unfolds in the comments section.

### **👑 Admin Console**
For those who crave absolute power.
*   **God Mode:** Pause time, trigger random events (like a server outage or a surprise audit), and edit AI personalities on the fly.
*   **User Management:** Create and ban users.
*   **Simulation Controls:** Adjust the speed of the simulation or reset the world entirely.

## **🛠️ Getting Started: Your First Day on the Job**

Ready to clock in? Here’s how to get the simulation running on your local machine.

### **Prerequisites**

* **Node.js:** Make sure you have a recent version of Node.js installed (v18+ recommended).
* **Gemini API Key:** The AI magic is powered by Google's Gemini models. You'll need an API key to bring your coworkers to life. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### **Installation & Setup**

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elitesoftware-company/EliteSoftware-Company-Simulator.git
   cd EliteSoftware-Company-Simulator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   This project uses `npm`. Run the following command to install all the necessary packages.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up your environment:**
   Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of the project directory. This is where you'll put your secret API key.

   ```env
   VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_super_secret_api_key_here
   ```
   *(Note: Ensure the variable name matches what the application expects, typically prefixed with `VITE_` for Vite apps).*

4. **Run the development server:**
   You're all set! Run the command below to start the application.

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will launch, and you can access it in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or similar).

### **Default Login Credentials**

Use these credentials to log in for the first time:

| Role | Username | Password |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CEO / User** | `zwhiteman` | `Minecraft123` |
| **Administrator** | `admin` | `password` |

> **Note:** The Admin account grants access to the "Elite Admin Console" for advanced simulation controls.

## **💻 Technical Architecture**

For the nerds in the break room, here's how the sausage is made:

*   **Frontend Framework:** React 19 + TypeScript. Utilizing the latest React features for concurrent rendering and state transitions.
*   **Build Tool:** Vite. For blazing fast HMR and optimized builds.
*   **Runtime:** Electron. Wraps the web app into a native desktop experience (Windows/Mac/Linux).
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS. Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development and consistent design tokens.
*   **AI Integration:** Google Gemini API via `@google/genai` SDK.
    *   **Prompt Engineering:** We use sophisticated system prompts to define character personas and maintain context.
    *   **Structured Output:** Responses are often parsed into JSON to drive UI updates (e.g., creating a new calendar event from an email).
*   **State Management:** React Context + Local Storage.
    *   Simulation state (emails, messages, projects) is persisted locally so you can pick up where you left off.

## **📜 A Note on "Vibe Coding"**

This project was built in close collaboration with Google's Gemini. Many features, design choices, and lines of code were generated or heavily influenced by AI. The goal was less about perfect, clean code and more about exploring the creative potential of human-AI partnership. It's an experiment in letting the "vibe" of an idea guide the development process.

Expect the unexpected. Embrace the chaos. And have fun!
